# It is assumed that, by convention, each of these directories contains
# the Python file __init__.py and a file named GenXXX.py where 'XXX' is
# the last subdirectory of each of the template directories. Hence
# "src/android" contains a GenAndroid.py file and "src/tl" contains a GenTL.py file.
#
# All .tmpl files in the named directories will be part of the installation.
#
# All files in directories below these directories, not just .tmpl files,
# will be part of the installation.
